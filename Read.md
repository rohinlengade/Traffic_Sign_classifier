The code classifies German traffic signs.
The dataset can be found here: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset

The model is trained and successfully classifies the traffic signs.

Later on, to analyse the performance, Images other than the onces in the german traffic signs dataset are used.
